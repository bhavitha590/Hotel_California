/* I try to find something that teach how to build a GUI in QT and I found a link below:
 *
http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/files/c-gui-programming-with-qt-4-2ndedition.pdf

And this is the tutorial for QT4 but I think it still help us to construct a GUI.
I will keep looking and update new files if I find a better one.
Cheers!
